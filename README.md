An app to track ClearFit Objectives, Key Results and Activities

You need an empty database as per conf/application.conf to get started.  The evolutions in /conf/evolutions/default/1.sql
will run when you start the app.  You'll be prompted to run them - it will create the schema for your app.

Create an invite to start adding a user to the system.  The invite is a unique hash that should be emailed out.  Right
now one needs to go to the list of invites and click a hash to create an account.

Once an account is created, click a username on the User list screen to view that person's objectives.  From the
objective list screen one can manage the person's objectives.

More to come.
